At the intersection of data science, artificial intelligence, and emergency response, I've spent nearly two decades applying technological solutions to humanitarian and environmental challenges. My journey began unexpectedly in Afghanistan in 2002, where, with a background in electrical engineering, I found myself managing humanitarian programs across food security, water, and infrastructure initiatives. Working with limited information while making decisions that affected communities in [Faryab province](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Faryab_Province) showed me firsthand the value of accessible, actionable data. This experience sparked a vision that has guided my career: transforming complex information into practical insights for decision-makers in time-sensitive situations.

As a consultant primarily with the [IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)](https://www.iaea.org) since 2012, I develop systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical application. Previously, I worked extensively with [UNHCR (The UN Refugee Agency)](https://www.unhcr.org/) and other UN bodies, where I specialized in mapping refugee settlements and establishing geospatial frameworks for humanitarian response. Whether designing decision support systems for nuclear emergencies at IAEA or implementing camp mapping solutions during the Darfur crisis, my focus remains on making data meaningful in high-stakes contexts.

Today, I specialize in artificial intelligence applications for decision support systems, exploring everything from Retrieval-Augmented Generation to fine-tuned small language models. My work focuses on adapting language models to specialized domains where general-purpose LLMs aren't required, developing systems that **augment human expertise with data-driven insights**, and enhancing transparency and explainability in complex decision-making processes.

Beyond my consulting work, I'm committed to knowledge-sharing as a technical educator, having conducted specialized courses in AI, data science, and emerging technologies across five continents. I've had the privilege of teaching for organizations including the IAEA, [International Center for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/) among others.

**On this blog, I share reflections from my work applying data and technology to practical challenges**. While my focus remains on purposeful applications rather than technology for its own sake, I'll occasionally indulge the engineer in me with deeper technical explorations of tools and methods I find particularly useful or interesting. 

Consider it a workbench where practical experience meets ongoing curiosity.
