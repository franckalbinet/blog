At the intersection of data science, artificial intelligence, and emergency response, I've spent nearly two decades applying technological solutions to humanitarian and environmental challenges. My journey began unexpectedly in Afghanistan in 2002, where, with a background in electrical engineering, I found myself managing humanitarian programs across food security, water, and infrastructure initiatives. Working with limited information while making decisions that affected communities in [Faryab province](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Faryab_Province), I knew I needed something that existed but wasn't yet accessible at scale - the ability to rapidly process vast amounts of unstructured data, identify patterns, and generate actionable insights for time-sensitive decisions. Today, with large language models and modern AI systems, that capability is finally available at scale, and I'm now building exactly those systems I desperately needed then.


As a consultant primarily with the [IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)](https://www.iaea.org) since 2012, I develop systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical application. Previously, I worked extensively with [UNHCR (The UN Refugee Agency)](https://www.unhcr.org/) and other UN bodies, where I specialized in mapping refugee settlements and establishing geospatial frameworks for humanitarian response. Today, I'm applying AI at scale to the same types of challenges - building systems like [IOM (International Organization for Migration)](https://www.iom.int)'s knowledge platform that processes hundreds of evaluation reports and [IAEA's marine radioactivity database](https://marise-dev-app.pla.sh) with integrated language models. Whether designing decision support systems for nuclear emergencies or implementing camp mapping solutions during crises, my focus remains on making data meaningful in high-stakes contexts.

**Today, I specialize in developing AI systems that augment human expertise with data-driven insights**, focusing on applications where reliability and explainability matter most. My work spans Retrieval-Augmented Generation and adapting language models to specialized domains, always with an eye toward practical deployment in operational environments.

My consulting work continues to blend data science with AI applications - maintaining my geospatial data science practice with IAEA while expanding into AI systems development for international organizations. Beyond consulting, I remain committed to knowledge-sharing as a technical educator, having conducted specialized courses in AI, data science, and emerging technologies across five continents for organizations including the IAEA and International Center for Theoretical Physics.

On this blog, I share insights from applying AI and data science to real-world challenges - consider it a workbench where practical experience meets ongoing curiosity.
