At the intersection of data science, artificial intelligence, and emergency response, I've spent nearly two decades applying technological solutions to some of the world's most pressing challenges. My journey began unexpectedly in Afghanistan in 2002, where as a young electrical engineer, I found myself making consequential decisions affecting thousands of livesâ€”often with limited information. This experience sparked a vision that has guided my career: transforming complex data into actionable insights for decision-makers facing urgent humanitarian and environmental challenges.

As a consultant for organizations including the [IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)](https://www.iaea.org), [UNHCR (The UN Refugee Agency)](https://www.unhcr.org/), and various UN bodies, I've developed systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical application. My work spans from mapping refugee settlements around the world to designing decision support systems for nuclear emergencies, always focused on making data meaningful in high-stakes contexts.

Today, I specialize in artificial intelligence applications for decision support systems, exploring everything from Retrieval-Augmented Generation to fine-tuned small language models. My work focuses on adapting language models to specialized domains where general-purpose LLMs aren't required, developing systems that **augment human expertise with data-driven insights**, and enhancing transparency and explainability in complex decision-making processes.

Beyond my consulting work, I'm committed to knowledge-sharing as a technical educator, having conducted specialized courses in AI, data science, and emerging technologies across five continents. I've had the privilege of teaching for organizations including the IAEA, [International Center for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/) among others.

**On this blog, I share reflections from my work applying data and technology to practical challenges**. While my focus remains on purposeful applications rather than technology for its own sake, I'll occasionally indulge the engineer in me with deeper technical explorations of tools and methods I find particularly useful or interesting. Consider it a workbench where practical experience meets ongoing curiosity.
